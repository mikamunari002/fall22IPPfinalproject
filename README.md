This project ended up being really cool because the use of selenium for more advanced using in areas like webscraping is incredible. Using selenium for complete automation of data analysis is an area that I want to keep learning a ton more about.

This change from the original game is something I'm super glad I did because I really see the practicality of this project and how it can be applied to the areas that I actually want to get into after I graudate college.

This is also a project that I want to continue to work on over the nect few weeks to keep increasing it's complexity and see what changes can be made to take this from a super simple beginners project to something that's genuinely dynamic and helpful.
