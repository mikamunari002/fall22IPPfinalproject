# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

#Type Test Racer

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

#A game the tests typing speed.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

#I'm going to create a function for a game that will test for typing speed in word, sentence, and paragraph 'modes'. The game pre designed lists of each type of "mode" in which the
#user can and will have to complete. The idea would be that there's a timer set up during the typing process  that will be set to track the users speed and an accumulation pattern 
#if the user is completing sentence and word modes. The game part would trying to cross the finish line before the computer character does. So, the timer is set up to or matched with a 
#computer's character and will move at a constant pace and the user's character will move depedent on typing speed.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

#Simply what I have outlined in the section above-- a pretty simplistic form of the game without many addons-- maybe the race occurs as a visual after the test instead of simultaneously..

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
#having all game modes and user interaction with the game. 


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

#Setting the race and typing to really cool visual enviroments.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

#I know that I'm going to have to user the Tkinter library, so I'm going to have to do some research on how to use and apply that into this. Another step will be
#figuring out to display two visuals next to each other simultaneosly 1.) the typing test 2.) the race visual. I'm also going to have to figure out how to make the 
#race work as a function of the game play, but I dont think that that step will be all to difficult. The other more minor things, are like user interactions (and such as:
#like choosing game mode, difficulty and other interactions with the game.
